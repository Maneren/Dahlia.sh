# Dahlia.sh

Dahlia is a simple text formatting package, inspired by text formatting in
the game Minecraft.

Text is formatted similarly to the game. With Dahlia, it is formatted by typing
a special character & followed by a format code and finally the text to be formatted.

## Installation

Download the source and put the `dahlia` executable in your `$PATH`.

## Dependencies

The scripts are written for GNU Bash 5.0/ZSH 5.9 and newer.

Other dependencies are reasonably modern (if someone knows how to find the
minimal required version, please let me know).:

- GNU `grep` and `sed` (non GNU version probably work too but aren't officially supported)
- GNU coreutils - `dirname`, `sort`, `uniq`

_Note: It is expected that all those commands are available in the `$PATH`._

## Usage

See `dahlia --help`
